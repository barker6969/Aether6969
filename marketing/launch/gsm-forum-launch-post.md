## Subject line (A/B test 3 variants)

1. `[TOOL] Aether Repair Suite — modern desktop app for MTK / Qualcomm / Samsung / Apple ($9 to try, $89/year)`
2. `Built a Chimera-style tool that actually runs on Windows 11, macOS ARM and Linux. Looking for beta testers.`
3. `Aether Repair Suite — one binary, no Java, no aging installer. Free credits for the first 50 testers.`

Variant 2 typically outperforms — it references pain points every forum member has felt.

## Body

Hey shop owners,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Been fixing phones on the side for 4 years and got fed up with:

- Chimera's Java installer breaking every quarter
- Octoplus needing a physical dongle plugged in 24/7
- UnlockTool crashing when I plug two devices in at once
- Every tool assuming I'm on Windows 7 or 10

So I built **Aether Repair Suite**. One native binary (Windows `.msi`, macOS Universal `.dmg`, Linux `.AppImage`). It talks to MTK BROM / Qualcomm Sahara + Firehose / Apple DFU / Samsung KG directly over USB — no browser tab, no bridge process, no dongle.

**What it does today** *(v0.1 — beta)*:
- MTK: FRP bypass, IMEI repair (dual SIM), partition read/write, DA-based flash
- Qualcomm: EDL sahara login, cable-free EDL entry, firehose flash, sec-repair
- Apple: DFU verify (checkm8 + pongoOS wrapping is planned — legacy A-series only)
- Samsung: Odin flash via Heimdall backend, Knox reset for supported models
- Dashboard shows a live "Cloud Exploit DB" feed — new CVEs pulled from the intel mesh so you know which devices just got a new working chain

**Video demo**: `[YOUR YOUTUBE LINK HERE]` — I flash a Redmi Note 12 FRP bypass in 47 seconds from a fresh Windows 11 install. No workarounds, no "run as admin" black magic.

**Pricing** (deliberately aggressive because I need to earn my slot on your workbench):
- **Impulse** — $9 for 15 credits (~$0.60/op) → just to try it
- **Starter** — $19 for 50 credits (~$0.38/op)
- **Solo Builder Edition** — $89/year, unlimited access to Solo tier operations + 50 credits/month
- **Founding Lifetime** — $299 one-time, first 100 buyers only, includes 500 credits + all future updates + your name in the Braiden Barker credits strip

**Founder deal for GSM-Forum members only**: reply with your forum username and I'll manually credit **50 free credits** to your account (enough for ~5 real operations). No CC needed for those. First 50 replies.

I'm here in the thread all day. Roast me on:
- Missing brands / chipsets you need first
- UI things that look off
- Pricing you'd actually pay
- Bugs you find (I'll patch and re-issue same-day)

If you want the code / to verify I'm not shipping malware:
- **Website**: [YOUR AETHER URL]
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/braidenbarker
- **Direct download**: [MSI/DMG/APPIMAGE LINKS]

Cheers,
Braiden Barker
Solo dev, Aether Repair Suite

## Reply-template snippets (paste directly in-thread)

### When someone asks "does it support X device":

> Right now the device signature catalog has 18 devices verified end-to-end. **[DEVICE]** isn't in that list yet — if you can spare 10 min to test on your bench I'll ship a same-day patch and give you 200 free credits + credit you in the release notes. DM me and I'll send you a pre-release build.

### When someone asks "why should I trust this over Chimera":

> Fair question. You shouldn't yet — I've got 4 years of shop time vs Chimera's 15. What I *can* offer is: (1) my source layout is open on GitHub so you can see there's no phone-home, (2) the app is single-signed static binary — no auto-updates without your consent, (3) if you find something Chimera does better tell me and I'll fix it in the next release. I'm not trying to replace them, I'm trying to be the tool you reach for when their Java installer eats itself again.

### When someone asks "is this open source":

> The UI, backend, and orchestrator are closed-source (for now) but the exploit modules use community tools you already trust: `mtkclient`, `heimdall`, `checkra1n`/`pongoOS`. The wrapper is Rust so it's auditable and static-linked. Long-term goal is to port everything to pure Rust and open-source the exploit orchestration layer — timeline is ~12 months.

### Damage control if someone reports a bricked device:

> Massive apologies. Ship me the device model, chipset, and the exact operation sequence + a screenshot of the log. I'll DM you my personal number, we'll debug live. Any bricked device on my software gets $200 toward a replacement or working unit shipped from my parts stock — no exceptions.

## Distribution checklist

- [ ] YouTube demo video ready (see `youtube-demo-script.md`)
- [ ] Landing page live at your domain
- [ ] Stripe checkout tested end-to-end with a real card
- [ ] `Impulse` $9 tier priced correctly in Stripe
- [ ] Analytics wired (know where each signup came from)
- [ ] Discord or Telegram group created for the first 50 users
- [ ] Screenshot of your setup wizard + dashboard (dark theme reads well)
- [ ] Post at **11 AM UTC on Tuesday** (peak forum traffic — India + EU + US morning overlap)
- [ ] Reply to every comment within 20 minutes for the first 48h. This is 90% of the game.

## After the post

- Cross-post to Reddit r/mobilerepair, r/PhoneRepair, r/AndroidQuestions the same day but 6-8h apart
- DM 5 known repair YouTubers with an early build + your founder story — one of them will make a video if you're helpful and non-pushy
- Watch **who buys the $9 Impulse pack first** — DM them thanks, ask them what they'd like next, use the reply as your v0.2 roadmap

**Rule of thumb**: 100 forum reads → 20 clicks → 3 signups → 1 Impulse purchase. If your first post gets 500 views the first day, expect $50-90 revenue day-one. That's a real signal.
